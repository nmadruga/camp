# Chamber scenario

J. Tian, B. Brem, M. West, T. C. Bond, M. J. Rood, and N. Riemer (2017) Simulating aerosol chamber experiments with the particle-resolved aerosol model CAMP, _Aerosol Sci. Technol._, (submitted).

This scenario simulates a chamber experiment, where an aerosol population is injected at the start (the initial condition) and is left to evolve for a period of time. This requires the use of fractal particles and chamber wall loss processes.
