#  Sample Batch Script for a Serial job
#
#  Submit this script using the command: qsub <script_name>
#
#  Use the "qstat" command to check the status of a job.
#
# The following are embedded QSUB options. The syntax is #PBS (the # does
# _not_  denote that the lines are commented out so do not remove).
#
# walltime : maximum wall clock time (hh:mm:ss)
#PBS -l walltime=00:05:00
#
# nodes: number of 8-core nodes
#   ppn: how many cores per node to use (1 through 8)
#       (you are always charged for the entire node)
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1
#
# export all my environment variables to the job
#PBS -V
#
# job name (default = name of script file)
###PBS -N testjob
#
#
# filename for standard output (default = <job_name>.o<job_id>)
# at end of job, it is in directory from which qsub was executed
# remove extra ## from the line below if you want to name your own file
###PBS -o testjob.out
#
# filename for standard error (default = <job_name>.e<job_id>)
# at end of job, it is in directory from which qsub was executed
# remove extra ## from the line below if you want to name your own file
###PBS -e testjob.err
#
# End of embedded QSUB options
#
# set echo               # echo commands before execution; use for debugging
